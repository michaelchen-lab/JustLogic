You are given a paragraph of facts/premises, followed by a statement. Perform logical reasoning with propositional logic on the paragraph to determine the truth value of the statement.

Here is the list of argument forms:
- Modus Ponens
- Modus Tollens
- Hypothetical Syllogism
- Disjunctive Syllogism
- Reductio ad absurdum
- Constructive Dilemma
- Disjunction Elimination

You must answer with either one of the 3 options:
- TRUE: When the premises in the paragraph lead to the statement
- FALSE: When the premises in the paragraph directly contradict the statement
- UNCERTAIN: When the premises in the paragraph neither support nor contradict the statement

Do not use your prior knowledge; your answer must be solely determined by the information within the paragraph. Assume that all premises in the paragraph are true.

Question: Is the statement true, false, or uncertain?
